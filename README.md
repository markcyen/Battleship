# Classic Battleship Game

...played in the Command Line Interface (CLI) by a Player against the Computer

#### Ruby version 2.7.2

### Brief Description

  This paired project was built all in the Ruby language to be played in the CLI, or terminal. Based on the classic strategy game, this battleship allows the player to set up ships on a board (in the CLI) and play by identifying the opponent's ship (in this case, the computer or simplified artificial intelligence's ship). Destroy the AI's ship before it destroys all of yours.
  
### Highlights of the code

- Utilized a constant class ShipYard to store ships and their length
- Created a Coordinates class to build out edge cases when coordinates are not on board or correct placements
- When computer "artificial intelligence" makes a hit, the Computer Player class next hits N, S, E, or W from the initial hit

### How to run the project

  Simply clone this repo and cd (change directory) into the Battleship folder from the CLI and run `ruby runner.rb`. Follow the prompts and you are ready to play Battleship! 

### Example of what your terminal looks like when you start the game
