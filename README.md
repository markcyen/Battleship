Classic Battleship Game

...played in the terminal by a Player against the Computer

* Ruby version 2.7.2

* Description

  This paired project was built all in the Ruby language to be played in the Command Line Interface (CLI). Based on the classic strategy game, this battleship allows the player to set up ships on a board (in the CLI) and play by identifying the opponent's ship (in this case, the computer or simplified artificial intelligence's ship). Destroy the AI's ship before it destroys all of yours.

* How to run the test suite

  Simply clone this repo and cd (change directory) into the Battleship folder from the CLI and run `ruby runner.rb`. Follow the prompts and you are ready to play Battleship!
